                <h2>Great Leader of Pakistan</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Mohammad Ali Jinnah</b> was a Pakistani politician and lawyer who is considered the founder of Pakistan. He was the leader of the All India Muslim League and is known as the "Quaid-e-Azam" (Great Leader) of Pakistan. He was born in Karachi in 1876 and studied at the Sindh Madrasah High School and later at the Bombay University. He began his political career in 1906 and soon became a leader of the Muslim community in India. In 1940, he proposed the idea of Pakistan as a separate Muslim state and worked tirelessly to achieve that goal. He became the first Governor-General of Pakistan in 1947 and died in 1948. He is considered one of the most important figures in Pakistani history.
